# ScheduleBot

ScheduleBot is designed to be a Columbia Physics preceptor's one-stop shop for pumping out lab, lab library, help room, grading, and proctoring schedules.

To ensure ScheduleBot works as expected, he will need 4 files from you:

1. A master schedule of student availability generated by exporting a Doodle poll to a .csv file. Couldn't be easier, just make sure your Doodle poll is made of 1 hr slots from 9am-10pm, M-F. Students must have this filled in **by checking off times during which they are busy!** (See master_schedule_sp19.csv for example)
2. A list of labs of the form (lab number, section number, day of week, start time (24 hr), end time (24 hr))=(1291,1,M,13:00,16:00). (See lab_list_sp19.csv for example)
3. A list of tests of the form (class number, professor name, day of week, date and time info, number of students)=(1402,Michael Tuts,R,"February 14, 10:10-11:25",175). (See proctor_grading_list_sp19.csv for example)
4. A list of how many times each TA has proctored and graded in the form of a tally list. (See proctor_grading_tally_sp19.csv for example)

Note that any and all .csv files can be created in Excel and exported as .csv files.
